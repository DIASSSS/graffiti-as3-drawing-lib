========================

ActionScript 3 Bitmap Drawing Library .v3

This library was made to help you add drawing into your AS3 app a little easier.

<h3>What's New?</h3>

* Object Drawing Mode - All of the current bitmap tools now have an object drawing mode. When this mode is used, your mark is converted into a Graffiti Object. This allows you to move, delete and update some of the properties of that object with the Selection Tool. The framework for this was introduced in v2.5 with the Text Object.</li>
* Save / Load Graffiti Objects - You can now save and load all Graffiti Objects including text. Graffiti Objects are exported as  XML formatted in the <a href="http://www.degrafa.org/">Degrafa</a> spec.</li>
* Multi-Object Selection - You can now select, modify, move and delete multiple objects on the canvas at once.</li>
