# Graffiti: ActionScript 3 Bitmap Drawing Library

The Graffiti AS3 Bitmap Drawing Library is designed for ActionScript developers to easily integrate drawing functionality into a Flash, Flex or Air project.

* Object Drawing Mode - All of the current bitmap tools now have an object drawing mode. When this mode is used, your mark is converted into a Graffiti Object. This allows you to move, delete and update some of the properties of that object with the Selection Tool. The framework for this was introduced in v2.5 with the Text Object.
* Save / Load Graffiti Objects - You can now save and load all Graffiti Objects including text. Graffiti Objects are exported as XML formatted in the Degrafa spec.
* Multi-Object Selection - You can now select, modify, move and delete multiple objects on the canvas at once.	 
* Get color value for a point on the drawing.		 
* Easily retrieve drawing data to use with your favorite image encoder.		
* UI independent code that fits invisibly into any project.
